<h1>Page versioning</h1>


<hr/>
<h1>Overview</h1>

Versioning is introduced to express several criterias:
<ul>
    <li>Feature set: Available resources (addressed by URLs) and operations (GET,DELETE,POST,PUT etc.)</li>
    <li>Domain model: Available resource data to read and write (expressed through <a href="schemas.html">XML schema-definitions</a>).</li>
    <li>Deprecated features: Resources and operations which were available earlier, but now are prohibited to be used.</li>
    <li>Down-compatibility: Upgrade-impact on api-clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meaning of down-compatibility</h2>
The Down-compatibility term is bound to the question whether a server's version upgrade could cause an existing api-client to break.
If an upgrade does not cause an api-client to break, then the upgrade is down-compatible.

<h3>Down-compatible upgrades</h3>
Following upgrades are down-compatible:
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>API-Change</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING a top-level element to XSD (top-level elements are OPTIONAL by definition)</td>
        <td>ad.xsd offers a new top-level element &lt;ads&gt;, which represents a collection.</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING an OPTIONAL nested element to XSD.</td>
        <td>Inside ad.xsd &lt;ads-search-options&gt; now offers a new nested
        'zipcode' to be able query ads by zipcode.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING an OPTIONAL attribute definition to any element inside XSD.</td>
        <td>types.xsd now defines an attribute 'default', so metadata can show default values, in case api-ctrent didn't submit any.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING a resource (addressed by URL).</td>
        <td>A new resource /users got added.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>supporting NEW operation on a resource.</td>
        <td>New users now can be added through POST /users.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Marking an element as DEPRECATED</td>
        <td>Inside ad.xsd &lt;ads-search-options&gt; support of query parameter 'userId' has
        been <a href="common-metadata.html#deprecated">deprecated</a>. Internally the server will still handle the parameter or fallback.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Non down-compatible upgrades</h3>
Following upgrades are not down-compatible:

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>API-Change</th>
        <th>Example</th>
        <th>Impact on api-client</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING a MANDATORY nested element to XSD.</td>
        <td>ad.xsd defines a mandatory &lt;user-id&gt; element.</td>
        <td>Api-client does not pass parameter and api-server would deny the request</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ADDING a MANDATORY attribute to an existing element inside XSD.</td>
        <td>users.xsd &lt;user&gt; has a new mandatory attribute 'id'.</td>
        <td>Api-clients request payload does not include this 'id' attribute and api-server would fail to process request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>REMOVING an OPTIONAL or MANDATORY element or attribute inside XSD (for avoidance <a href="common-metadata.html#deprecated">deprecate flags</a> exist).</td>
        <td>Inside ad-2.0 &lt;ads-search-options&gt; support of query parameter 'userId' has been removed completely.</td>
        <td>Api-ctrent would still include the element/attribute, but api-server wouldn't be aware of them. In some circumstances
        the api-server could still work and just discard these values.</td>
     </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>REMOVING a resource.</td>
        <td>/users is removed.</td>
        <td>api-client could use the resource and would break through '404 Not Found' response code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>REMOVING support of an operation.</td>
        <td>Removed write support for /users (no PUT/POST/DELETE).</td>
        <td>Api-client could have write a feature to that resource but then would break by a '404 Not Found' or '501 Not Implemented'.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CHANGE of resource + operation semantics.</td>
        <td>Doing a POST on /ads would not create an user imptrctily behind the scenes any longer.</td>
        <td>Api-client expectation that user is created automatically doesn't apply any longer. A necessary POST on /users
        isn't done and therefore posting an ad fails.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h1>Version numbering </h1>

Versioning has 3 digits:
<ol>
    <li>D.x.x: Major versions imply non-compatible changes. Upgrading from a 1.x.x version to a 2.x.x could break an api-client
        based on 1.x.x.</li>
    <li>x.D.x: Minor versions imply compatible changes. Upgrading from 1.1.x to 1.6.x would not break an api-client.</li>
    <li>x.x.D: Minor-minor version upgrades contain bug-fixes based on x.D.x version. It is invisible for api-clients and is for internal use only .</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="xsd-version">XSD Versioning</a></h2>
The available resource data for read/write is expressed through <a href="schemas.html">XML schema-definitions</a>. The versioning
info is encoded in two items:
<ul>
    <li>Target-Namespace represents Major version.</li>
    <li>'version' attribute inside root tag defines minor version.</li>
</ul>

XSD (example ad.xsd):
<textarea class="xml">

<xs:schema ...
    <!-- Major version (targetNamespace): -->
    targetNamespace="http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com/schema/ad/v1"
    <!-- Minor version: -->
    version="1.1">
    ...
</xs:schema>
</textarea>


XML Instance (based on XSD) are the concrete resource representation documents. Example: 'GET /ads' is
bound to ad.xsd. <br/><br/>

The upgrades of minor versions inside XSDs are done through compatible changes, the visibilty of change is
encoded inside the 'version' attribute:
<textarea class="xml">
<ad:ads ...
    <!-- Major version (targetNamespace): -->
    xmlns:ad="http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com/schema/ad/v1"
    <!-- Minor version: -->
    version="1.3">
    ....
</ad:ads>

</textarea>
